In September 2022 I joined the Frontend developer program on Changemaker educations. They've provided me additional knowledge about HTML, Javascript & css. Also about git, github, jQuery, API's, Figma. To enhance inspiration and playfullness I also create AI-art in Midjorney. Further on I'm exited to learn more about how to write sufficient code in jsx and  dive deeper into design. "
